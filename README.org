Julia package that helps with statistics for random processes

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
This Julia package is part of the Julia package repository [[https://github.com/dojt/DOT_JuliaPackageRegistry][DOT_JuliaPackageRegistry]].  It relies on packages stored
there, and can be added from there[fn:1].  (The convenient way to do that is by through the standard Julia package
[[https://github.com/GunnarFarneback/LocalRegistry.jl][LocalRegistry.jl]].
#+END_QUOTE

[fn:1] ... as soon as the first stable version is ready. [fn:: Sorry, looks like GitHub cannot render Org footnotes
properly.]
